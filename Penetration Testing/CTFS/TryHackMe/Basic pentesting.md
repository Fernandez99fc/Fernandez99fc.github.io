What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server?

Navigating to /development, we see 2 text files dev.txt and J.txt

Can't find any useful info here at the moment, but seems they're up to something. might make reference to this later.

What is the username? Username of what? 
Using nmap to scan for open ports on the server:

![Screenshot (108)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb096b5-4b47-45cb-81e6-cd7cb40b2629)

ports 22(ssh),80(http), 139 and 445(samba) are open

Realized the ssh version is vulnerable to username enumeration by providing a wordlist, also smb is vulnerable to username enumeration by using enum4linux.

We can use enum4linux to enumerate smb service to gather usernames, shares, os info, workgroups e.t.c

Here, we can see just 2 shares hosted on the smb server:
Anonymous which is a disk share(storage) and $IPC.

I was able to find usernames "kay" and "jan".

After running a bruteforce to find passwords for both usernames,  I found password for jan which is "armando"

(Note: Had a session timeout, Ip address had to change)
