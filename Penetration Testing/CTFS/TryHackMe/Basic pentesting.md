What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server?

Using directory bruteforce to find hidden files and directories

Navigating to /development, we see 2 text files dev.txt and J.txt

Can't find any useful info here at the moment, but seems they're up to something. might make reference to this later.

What is the username? Username of what? 
Using nmap to scan for open ports on the server:

![Screenshot (108)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb096b5-4b47-45cb-81e6-cd7cb40b2629)

ports 22(ssh),80(http), 139 and 445(samba) are open

Realized the ssh version is vulnerable to username enumeration by providing a wordlist, also smb is vulnerable to username enumeration by using enum4linux.

We can use enum4linux to enumerate smb service to gather usernames, shares, os info, workgroups e.t.c

Here, we can see just 2 shares hosted on the smb server:
Anonymous which is a disk share(storage) and $IPC.

I was able to find usernames "kay" and "jan".

After running a bruteforce to find passwords for both usernames,  I found password for jan which is "armando"

(Note: Had a session timeout, Ip address had to change)

Logging into ssh server with the credentials found, username "jan" and password "armando".

Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation:

After logging in, we are able to change directory to /home/jay which is jay's home directory. Using ls -al we can see hidden files and directories including .ssh which contains ssh keys.
![Screenshot (116)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbe77769-6a7f-44f9-9b4f-49e153e3b999)

We can copy the content of the private key to jan's home directory or to our local machine into a text  file.
After that we can try to login with the "-i" argument to specify the private key file.
![Screenshot (117)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce6d513-9753-485a-b274-08f7db33bf49)

But looks like the private key is having a password with it. We can try cracking the key  to retreive the password using johntheRipper.
But before that, we need to make the key file compatible with john. We will use ssh2john which is most times preinstalled with debian based systems. 

syntax: ssh2john [key file] > newkeyfile.txt
![Screenshot (118)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fac1e9-d119-4816-a019-e5e3c0b21833)

After that we can start using to john to crack the key using:

"john  --wordlist:/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt [newkeyfile.txt]

Using the rockyou.txt wwordlist to crack
