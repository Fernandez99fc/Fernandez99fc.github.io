# Wireless Security Assessment

The objective of this task is to simulate a vulnerability assessment on a Small office wireless network, analyzing potential risks, impact and provide mitigation techniques to safeguard the company's critical data from threat actors.

# Network scanning:
Perform a network scan within the range of the wireless networks to discover wireless access points/routers. We discovered an ssid of a wireless Ap "GhostInTheWires" which happens to reside within the office building and uses Wpa2 psk encryption

# Methodology:
One of the devices is connected to it, to break into the wifi network, we need to capture the 4 way handshake sent from a connecting device(client) to the router. One way we can achieve this, is to disconnect the client from the access point by spoofing deauth frames from the router to the client and the client will have to reconnect back to the router, during this process we can capture the handshake containing the session key then we can crack the wifi password.
* Tools: Aircrack-ng, Aireplay-ng

# Exploitation

Client should be disconnected after sending deauth frames, now we wait for the client to reconnect back to capture the handshakes.

Now that we have the handshake, we can crack using aircrack-ng.

We were able to crack the password and it's "222222222".

The vulnerability within wpa and wpa2 is that management frames are not protected. Management frames are used to manage, establish or teardown connection sessions between a router and the clients. A deauth frame is used to deauthenticate a client from it'a access point. It is sent from an access point to a client to tell it that it's connection is being terminated or from the client to the  access point. 

# Risk
* The topology shows that each departments are interconnected within the same network and subnet which is bad. There are a lot of attack surfaces which resides mainly among the 3 access points broadcasting wireless signals, just one might be vulnerable to an attack. If the attack is successful, an attacker can then perform lateral movement & pivoting.

# Mitigation
* Wpa3- Latest iteration of wpa which is the latest release after woa2. Provides MFP(Management frame protection). With mfp, management frames are protected and cannot be spoofed/abused by an attacker.
* Wired connection- Using a wired connection is more safe and less prone to wireless attacks. Disabling ssid and making use of a wired connection can put you on a safer side.
* Password complexity - Make use of a complex and long passphrase. This would make password cracking impossible.
* Network Segmentation: Placing each department in a different network by creating different subnets can minimize the damage of a cyber attack. An access point hacked would only affect that particular department connected to that access point/network and also protects against pivoting. This type of defense technique can be achieved by subnetting and vlans.
