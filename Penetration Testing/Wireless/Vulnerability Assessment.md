# Wireless penetration test

The goal of this project is to perform a vunerability assessment on a Small office wireless network, analyzing potential risks, impact and implement security measures to safeguard the company's critical data from threat actors.

# Network scanning:
Perform a network scan within the range of the wireless networks to discover wireless access points/routers. We discovered an ssid of a wireless Ap "GhostInTheWires" which happens to reside within the office building and uses Wpa2 psk encryption

# Methodology:
One of the devices is connected to it, to break into the wifi network, we need to capture the 4 way handshake sent from a connecting device(client) to the router. One way we can achieve this, is to disconnect the client from the access point by spoofing deauth frames from the router to the client and the client will have to reconnect back to the router, during this process we can capture the handshake containing the session key then we can crack the wifi password.
* Tools: Aircrack-ng, Aireplay-ng

Client should be disconnected after sending deauth frames, now we wait for the client to reconnect back to capture the handshakes.
