YOU CAN CAPTURE WIFI,BLUETOOTH AND WIRED NETWORK TRAFFICS
SPARK LINES ARE THE FREQUENCY SEEN BELOW WHEN YOU WANT TO SELECT AN INTERFACE TO START THE CAPTURE.  SPARKLINE SHOWS THAT THERE'S AN ACTIVE CONNECTION AND THAT IT'S EXCHANGING DATA.

TWO TYPES OF ETHERNET ENVIRONMENTS
--
SHARED OR HUB-BASED
SWITCHED NETWORK

IF WE ARE ON A WIRELESS NETWORK, WE CAN SEE ALL TRAFFIC CONNECTED TO THE WIRELESS ACCESS POINT JUST LIKE A SHARED-HUB. HUB BROADCASTS MESSAGES INTENDED FOR A DESTINED COMPUTERS. BUT IF YOUR'E CONNECTED TO A SWITCH, YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO SEE NETWORK TRAFFIC FOR YOUR OWN COMPUTER. 

TO SEE ALL OTHER NETWORK TRAFFICS-:
- PORT MIRRORING OR SPAN(SWITCHED PORT ANALYSIS)
- MONITOR ON THE DEVICE
- FULL DUPLEX TAP IN LINE WITH TRAFFIC
- NEED A SPECIAL ADAPTER
HEXDUMP- PACKET BYTES. CAN BE CONVERTED TO BINARY.

WIRESHARK PACKET CAPTURE STAGES-:
- TAP IN CORRECT LOCATION USING THE RIGHT CAPTURE ENGINE
- GATHER TRAFFIC
- DECODE USING EPAN OR ETHERIAL PACKET ANALYSIS WHICH IS THE CORE ENGINE FOR WIRESHARK.
- THEN DISPLAYS IN A HUMAN READABLE FORMAT

tcp header is 20bytes, plus other options it can be any size including the tcp 20 bytes.
sack-means selective acknowledgement- means you can continue sending data even if it's not in in order.

udp is used for time sensitive applications like:
dns(domain name server)
voip(voice over ip)
routing information protocol
tftp(trivial file transfer protocol)

udp is 8 bytes long,includes the source and destination ports, length and checksum. it's checksum is used for error detection not correction.
