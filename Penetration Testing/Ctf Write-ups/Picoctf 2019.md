We have been provided a link above to visit. We get a blank page with the message below

The hint button on the page could tell us that the admin doesn't want us to see some parts of the website. This is mostly specified in the robots.txt file to tell web crawlers which area of the website should be shown to normal users.
An attacker can try ti visit the file by placing the file path at the end of the url
